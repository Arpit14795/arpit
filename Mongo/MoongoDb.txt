MONGO DB:-

It is open source so anyone can download and install it.
It doesn't need any database preinstalled in machine.

There is 2 files called
        mongodb.exe
        mongo.exe

There are 3 ways to start a server.

mongod

mongod--logpath<> --locationpath<>

mongo -f (for config file)

mongodb is server and mongo is client.


create a new folder in C: Named DATA/db(it is default location)

Open cmd and go to the directory till bin folder.
now command                                 -   mongod
then open one more window of cmd and command-   mongo

It will show connected.

If you want to specify a log file then can specify that


Here is a point to keep in mind that
Collection is Table
Document is Record

Assuming that you are connected with client
Now begin the game of commands:-

>show dbs
>use database_name
Here db is automatically pointing to current database
employee is Document name
>db.employee.insert
     Here we have two options  XML  JSON
  In Jason format
 db.employee.insert([{id:1,name:"arpit"}])
  In XML format
 db.employee.insert({id:1,name:"arpit"})

We can insert array as well and can add any attribute

 JSON- db.employee.insert([{id:1,name:"arpit"},{id:2,name:"sonu"}])
  XML-db.employee.insert({id:1,name:"arpit"},{id:2,name:"sonu"})

var doc1={id:1,name:"arpit"};
>db.employees.insert(doc1)



>db.employee.count()
>db.stats();

If we want to see the body of method then call without parenthesis
>db.employee.count
>db.stats


>db.getCollectionNames()
>db.employee.find()
>db.employee.find().pretty()

To find any Document in Collection 
>db.employee.find({name:"arpit"}).pretty()

To find any Document with AND condition
>db.employee.find({name:"arpit",id:1}).pretty()


To find any Document with OR condition
>db.employee.find({$or:[{name:"arpit"},{id:1}]}).pretty()



To find any Document with greater than condition
>db.employee.find({name:"arpit",id:{$gte:1}}).pretty()
